# Supply chain Dapp
This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized App, in particular an Agrifood Suppy Chain Dapp. <br/>
It has been developed with the purpose to provide transparency and
clarity to all consumers interacting with this market. The consumer, in fact, will be able to check the
entire productâ€™s  chain (Farmer, Distributor and obviously Retailer). This main functionality,
namely traceability, is reached using logs (cheaper option to store data) generated by the emitted
events. <br/>
Each participant in this market can visualize a series of infos about the products, all these infos cannot be tampered (e.g production date,
expiration date)

## Tech stack
The technologies used in this project are: <br/>
- Hardhat (Ethereum development environment) 
- Solidity (Smart contract)
- React.js (User interface)
- Ethers.js

## Demo
It gives an insight of the Dapp (it show just the final step of the supply chain) <br/>
<br/>

## How to install and use it
The first things to do are cloning repo and installing dependencies: <br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/oculus-prime/Supply_chain-DAPP.git
cd Supply_chain_Dapp
npm install
```
Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:<br/>
```
npx hardhat node
```
Then on a new terminal, go to the repo's root folder and deploy the smart contract: <br/>
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```
Now we can run the frontend with: <br/>
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The Dapp wille be rendered on https://localhost:3000/. You'll need to have Metamask installed and listening to 'localhost 8545'
with chainID '31337'.
